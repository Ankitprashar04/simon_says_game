# 🧠 Simon Says Game – A JavaScript Memory Challenge

Welcome to the **Simon Says Game**, a fun and interactive browser-based memory challenge built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
Inspired by the classic *Simon* electronic game, this project tests your ability to remember and repeat color sequences that grow progressively harder with each level.

---

## 🌟 Overview

In this game, players must observe a series of color flashes and replicate them in the correct order. Each round, the sequence becomes longer, testing your focus and memory retention.
If you make a mistake, the game ends — but don’t worry, you can start again and try to beat your previous score!

This project is an excellent practice for understanding **DOM manipulation, event handling, array logic, and dynamic UI updates** in JavaScript.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build an engaging memory game from scratch using pure JavaScript.
* Strengthen understanding of event listeners, arrays, and condition checking.
* Implement visual effects and smooth transitions to enhance user experience.

---

## ⚙️ Features

✅ **Dynamic Color Sequence:**
A random color is added to the sequence each time you progress to a new level.

✅ **Interactive Button Effects:**
Each color button flashes when pressed or played back by the system.

✅ **Level System:**
The game automatically tracks and displays your current level.

✅ **Game Over & Restart:**
On making a mistake, the screen flashes red, your score is displayed, and the game resets for a new attempt.

✅ **Keyboard Control:**
Start the game instantly by pressing any key.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. **Start the Game** – Press any key to begin.
2. **Watch Carefully** – A color will flash on the screen.
3. **Repeat the Pattern** – Click the same color.
4. **Level Up** – Each round adds a new color to the sequence.
5. **Don’t Make a Mistake!** – If you click the wrong color, the game ends.
6. **Restart** – Press any key to play again and try to reach a higher level.

## 🧠 Game Logic Explanation

The game uses two arrays:

* `gameSeq` → Stores the randomly generated color sequence.
* `userSeq` → Stores the colors clicked by the user.

Each round:

* A random color is added to `gameSeq`.
* The user must replicate the same order using button clicks.
* The function `checkAns()` compares `userSeq` and `gameSeq` step by step.
* If the sequence matches, the game continues to the next level.
* If not, the game resets with a *“Game Over”* message and background flash effect.

## 💻 Setup and Installation

To run the game locally:

1. **Clone this repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simon-says-game.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**

   ```bash
   cd simon-says-game
   ```

3. **Open the game:**
   Just open the `index.html` file in your browser. No server setup required!

---

## 🎨 UI and Animation

* Each button (red, green, yellow, purple) is animated using CSS transitions.
* A **flash effect** indicates system-generated moves, while a **user-flash** highlights player actions.
* The background briefly flashes red during game over to create an alert effect.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

🔹 Add **sound effects** for each button press and game event.
🔹 Implement **mobile touch support** for better phone experience.
🔹 Display **highest score** using browser localStorage.
🔹 Add **dark mode** or animated backgrounds for aesthetic appeal.
🔹 Introduce **difficulty modes** (easy, medium, hard).
